# C++ Algorithms, Warmups, and Projects

This repository contains a growing collection of C++ exercises focused on building fluency in algorithms, data structures, STL mastery, and foundational systems programming concepts.  
It serves as a structured practice environment designed to strengthen problem-solving, engineering discipline, and preparation for high-performance software and quant roles.

## 🔧 Structure Overview

The repository is organized into thematic modules:

### **Tier-2 (Foundations & Fluency)**
Warmups covering essential C++ concepts:
- `vector`, `map`, `set`, `queue`, `priority_queue`
- references and pointers
- structs and OOP basics
- file I/O
- small practice scripts demonstrating STL usage

These exercises build practical fluency with the language and strengthen instincts around performance, memory, and data structures.

### **Tier-3 (Algorithms & Systems-Level Skills)**
More advanced modules that will include:
- sliding window & two pointers
- heaps and top-K problems
- BFS/DFS and graph logic
- dynamic programming warmups
- basic simulations and system-style exercises
- performance-oriented C++ patterns

## 🧩 Goals

This repository is part of an ongoing journey to:

- Strengthen C++ fundamentals through consistent practice  
- Build interview-ready problem-solving skills  
- Develop clean, scalable coding habits  
- Experiment with real-world patterns used in quant, trading, and systems roles  
- Maintain a public record of technical growth

## 🛠️ Build & Run

All examples compile with a modern C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 file.cpp -o app
./app
